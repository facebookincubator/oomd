#include "oomd/plugins/SenpaiCommon.h"

// This is a Senpai plugin which works by continuously adjusting a
// memory limit in order to keep pressure steady.
//
// When deciding when to act, Senpai will take a look at the
// observed pressure vs the target pressure and calculate some
// error function - `abs(observed - target) / target`

// Senpai can act every "tick" of the oomd loop or do nothing. The
// time since the last action (e.g. setting of the memory limit)
// must factor in here because it captures some level of certainty
// that the observed pressure was due to the last action or not.

// To give an example, Senpai could set a limit too low, reclaim a
// bunch of memory and then in the next tick adjust the limit much
// higher. Refaults from memory reclaimed in the first setting could
// cause pressure after the second setting. The longer it has been
// since Senpai last took action, the more certain we are that the
// observed pressure is a function of the last action.
//
// In order to capture this, Senpai will act when the error exceeds
// some threshold that decays exponentially over time.
