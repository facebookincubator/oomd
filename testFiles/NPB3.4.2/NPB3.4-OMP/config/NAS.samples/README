This directory contains examples of make.def files that were used 
by the NPB team in testing the benchmarks on different platforms. 
They can be used as starting points for make.def files for your 
own platform, but you may need to taylor them for best performance 
on your installation. A clean template can be found in directory 
`config'.
Some examples of suite.def files are also provided.
