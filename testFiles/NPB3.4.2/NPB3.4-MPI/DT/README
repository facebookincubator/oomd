Data Traffic benchmark DT is new in the NPB suite 
(released as part of NPB3.x-MPI package).
----------------------------------------------------

DT is written in C and same executable can run on any number of processors,
provided this number is not less than the number of nodes in the communication
graph.  DT benchmark takes one argument: BH, WH, or SH. This argument 
specifies the communication graph Black Hole, White Hole, or SHuffle 
respectively. The current release contains verification numbers for 
CLASSES S, W, A, and B only.  Classes C and D are defined, but verification 
numbers are not provided in this release.

The following table summarizes the number of nodes in the communication
graph based on CLASS and graph TYPE.

CLASS  N_Source N_Nodes(BH,WH) N_Nodes(SH)
 S      4        5              12
 W      8        11             32
 A      16       21             80
 B      32       43             192
 C      64       85             448
 D      128      171            1024
