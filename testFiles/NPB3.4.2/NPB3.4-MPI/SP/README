This code implements a 3D Multi-partition algorithm for the solution 
of the uncoupled systems of linear equations resulting from 
Beam-Warming approximate factorization.  Consequently, the program 
must be run on a square number of processors.  The included file 
"npbparams.h" contains a parameter statement which sets "maxcells" 
and "problem_size".  The parameter maxcells must be set to the 
square root of the number of processors.  For example, if running 
on 25 processors, then set max_cells=5.  The standard problem sizes 
are problem_size=64 for class A, 102 for class B, and 162 for class C.

The number of time steps and the time step size dt are set in the 
npbparams.h but may be overridden in the input deck "inputsp.data".  
The number of time steps is 400 for all three 
standard problems, and the appropriate time step sizes "dt" are 
0.0015d0 for class A, 0.001d0 for class B, and 0.00067 for class C.
